# Antlerhealth
Telemedicine platform
We're creating Antler, an innovative AI-powered digital health application that enables Shona,Ndebele and English speakers to access vital primary care services and manage their health data within a single app. Its AI-powered, voice-interactive health assistant can triage patients in their chosen language (Shona,Ndebele or English), gathering their symptoms and medical history to connect them with the appropriate doctor. Antler facilitates essential primary care services, like symptom reporting and appointment scheduling, through text and voice communication on both mobile and web platforms, greatly simplifying access for those with limited technical skills. 

Furthermore, for doctors, we offer AI-generated, comprehensive recommendations for clinical decision support to streamline the consultation process. Through an interactive dashboard, doctors have access to patients' appointment requests, past medical conditions, and current symptoms, complemented by precise AI-generated recommendations. These include provisional diagnoses and personalized treatment plans that consider a range of risk factors, thereby optimizing decision-making in video consultations and markedly decreasing consultation times.Medical data is huge so a clinical decision support system basically ensures that Doctors are able to do better diagnosis so that drug interactions, dosages ,associations and contraindications are sorted out and doctors can focus on the patient rather than trying to think through the data. Post-consultation, we enhance the prescription with customized digital health education in the patientâ€™s chosen language, empowering them to better manage their health independently.
